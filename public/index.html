            <p>
                Totally Automated Accessibility Scanner is a completely free
                tool which automatically detects and reports common accessibly
                violations on your website. Unfortunately you still have to
                manually read and fix the errors but hopefully you'll learn a
                bit about accessibility as you do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tota<strong>ll</strong>y is built from the accessibility
                visualization toolkit <a href="https://khan.github.io/tota11y/">
                tota<strong>11</strong>y by Khan Academy</a>. Totally runs in
                your browser's sidebar and like tota11y helps you to
                visualise how your site performs with assistive technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Totally is designed to help you identify a number of accessibility
                concerns relating to the comprehensive guidelines maintained
                by the WC3 in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG</a>
                without prior accessibility knowledge to make sense of the
                results.

            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                When Totally is running you will see a transparent icon with
                glasses in the bottom left corner of your webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                In your sidebar you can enable and disable Plugins.
                If you can't see this sidebar you need to open it first under
                View -> Sidebar -> Totally Automated A11y Scanner.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you enable a Plugin it runs on the current page and creates
                an InfoPanel below the menu. Each Plugin tests for different
                accessibility criteria and may create annotations on the page
                or list errors in their InfoPanel. All plugins also have an
                About tab in their InfoPanel which provides supporting
                information.

                Many Totally Plugins also suggest fixes for the accessibility
                violations they find on your page, as well as providing
                supporting information and links to help you understand what's
                gone wrong.

            <h2>What can't it do</h2>
            <p>
                Even WebExtensions do not have privileges for everything and
                not every possible test has been written. Totally doesn't
                test for many important accessibility concerns relating to
                keyboard input (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html">such as no keyboard trap</a>),
                timing constraints, content that may cause seizures,
                mouse pointer input, and many other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG Success Criteria</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of these are not possible to automate from a WebExtension
                and others require real semantic understanding of the webpage
                rather than just parsing the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is hoped that Totally Automated Accessibility Scanner is
                still helpful but it will never be a complete substitute for
                manual accessibly testing.

                Many plugins and much code in general comes from
                <a href="https://khan.github.io/tota11y/">tota11y by Khan Academy</a>.
                In turn many of those features come from
                <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools">Google Chrome's Accessibility Developer Tools</a>.
                You will still see tota11y mentioned all over this project if
                you inspect the CSS names and the code.
